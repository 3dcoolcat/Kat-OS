## Shell Directory
This directory is meant for the source as well as the compiled files with documentation for every shell command, with the goal of being as user friendly and intuitive as possible.
#### For Example...
The structure of a shell command might look like this...
```
/Shell
  |Command
    |Command.c    Source
    |Command      Linux Executable
    |Command.txt  Plain Text Documentation
    |Command.md   Markdown Documentation
```
